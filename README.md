Advanced Apple Mail to Evernote
===============================

Advanced Apple Mail to Evernote is an AppleScript which exports Apple Mail messages to Evernote as part of a GTD workflow. 

Original code for this script was written by Veritrope.com and can be found here: http://veritrope.com/code/apple-mail-to-evernote/. By forking this awesome piece of AppleScript, my goal was to improve it by adding some features relevant to my personal GTD workflow.
